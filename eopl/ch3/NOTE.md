# Exercise 3.19 - 3.29

Since there are two implementations for PROC language,
I will do the exercise based on the data structure representation
(i.e. `ds-rep` directory in the corresponding path of `eopl3`)
unless I claim it explicitly.

# `run.rkt`

I test my procedures by using the testcases.
Run `run.rkt` will usually go through all the testcases
and give the result whether there are some bugs or not.

To see all the testcases, read the corresponding `tests.rkt` inside each directory.
