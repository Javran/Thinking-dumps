\section*{Exercise 4.1}

The program will output ``\texttt{0}''

The counter is created inside of the procedure
rather than sharing among each procedure created.

In the original version, the counter is created only once.
Then the counter is stored
inside the procedure's environment.

In the second version, the counter is created every time
when \texttt{g} is called.
