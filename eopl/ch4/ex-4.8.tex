\section*{Exercise 4.8}

The inefficiency is because that the store is implemented
out of the list structure, which does not have features to
support efficient random access.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{deref}: uses \texttt{list-ref} which would run in linear time.
    \item \texttt{setref!}: keeps traveling the list until the correct location
            is reached, which takes linear time.
    \item \texttt{newref}: uses \texttt{append} which would run in linear time.
\end{itemize}
