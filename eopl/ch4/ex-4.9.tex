\section*{Exercise 4.9}

The lost is the flexibility of the store length.

To implement the store in constant time, we have to avoid
using something like \texttt{vector-append}.
So we are enforced
to use a store of fixed length.

So we can no longer maintain a store that has theoretically unlimited length. 

The correctness is guaranteed only if the store is capable of storing everything
the program needed.
