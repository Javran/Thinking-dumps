# Thinking dumps

This repo keeps track of my codes, answers and thinkings when exploring books.

I like to learn things by repeating what others have done,
from which I'd like to find something new.

That's why this repo is called "Thinking dumps".

Please feel free to use the codes or share your thinking with me.
