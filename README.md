I do feel a sense of regret 
when I found they are plenty of books purchased and links bookmarked keeping unread.

So I want to fix this, by converting these highly valued things into what they are truly valued for.

This repo keeps track of test codes and exercises' answers for the books/links I've read or I'm currently reading.

Please feel free to use the codes or to share your thoughts with me.
