# Difference Of Squares

Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025.

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is
1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385.

Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first
ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first ten
natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.
