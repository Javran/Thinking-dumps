# Wordy

Write a program that takes a word problem and returns the answer as an integer.

## Step 1

E.g.

> What is 5 plus 13?

The program should handle large numbers and negative numbers.

Remember, that these are verbal word problems, not treated as you
normally would treat a written problem.  This means that you calculate
as you move forward each step.  3 + 2 * 3 = 15, not 9.

Use the tests to drive your solution by deleting the `skip` in one test
at a time.

## Step 2

E.g.

> What is 5 plus 13?

> What is 7 minus 5?

> What is 6 multiplied by 4?

> What is 25 divided by 5?

## Step 3

E.g.

> What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?

> What is 7 minus 5 minus 1?

> What is 9 minus 3 plus 5?

> What is 3 plus 5 minus 8?

## Step 4

E.g.

> What is 5 plus 13?

> What is 7 minus 5?

> What is 6 times 4?

> What is 25 divided by 5?

> What is 78 plus 5 minus 3?

> What is 18 times 3 plus 16?

> What is 4 times 3 divided by 6?

> What is 4 plus 3 times 2?

## Extensions

Implement questions of the type:

> What is 2 raised to the 5th power?

Remember to write failing tests for this code.

## Running Tests

Use `runhaskell` (included in the Haskell Platform) to compile and run your
Haskell code.

    $ runhaskell -Wall bob_test.hs
