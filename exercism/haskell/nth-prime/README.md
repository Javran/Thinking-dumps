# Nth Prime

Write a program that can tell you what the nth prime is.

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that
the 6th prime is 13.

If your language provides methods in the standard library to deal with prime
numbers, pretend it doesn't exist and implement it yourself.

## Running Tests

Use `runhaskell` (included in the Haskell Platform) to compile and run your
Haskell code.

    $ runhaskell -Wall bob_test.hs
