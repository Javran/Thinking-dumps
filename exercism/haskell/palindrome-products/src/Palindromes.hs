We have 2 approaches:

* the most naive one attempts all products
  (this approach is running rather slow on test cases)

* using the property of the search space helps us to
  reduce number of attempts needed: if we are finding the smallest
  palindrome, and we know that a*b is one candidate,
  then searching a*(b+1), a*(b+2) ... won't give us better solutions
  so we can stop right here and continue with attempting (a+1)* ???
