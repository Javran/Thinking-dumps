  observation:

- basically doing the same thing:

> viewTy tint
"Int"
> viewTy (unTQ tint)
"Int"
> viewTy (unTQ (unTQ tint))
"Int"
> viewTy (unTQ (unTQ (unTQ tint)))
"Int"

my guess is by doing so we are delaying the choice of instance
until "unTQ" destruction.

- trying safeGCast function:

> isJust (safeGCast tint (Identity 1) (tint `tarr` tint))
False
> isJust (safeGCast tint [1,3,4,5] (tint `tarr` tint))
False
> runIdentity (fromJust (safeGCast (tint `tarr` tint) (Identity (+ 20)) (tint `tarr` tint))) 5

{-
  it seems "Q" in "TQ" means quantification, and now we have "TCOPY"
  which looks like an alternative to it.
  I guess after all this is just a type representation,
  unlike values that we can do all sorts of things: printing, interpreting, there are simply
  not much we can do with types. but I do suspect this makes a difference
  when we are trying to do multiple things with "tt1 :: TSYM trepr => trepr a",
  which would force "trepr" be either (but not both)
