    TODO: "every edge is unique" is a bit wrong, need to fix it somehow.
    TODO: currently edges only have their both ends stored as fields,
    the extra data has to be stored somewhere, maybe "WeightedEdge a w" = (Edge a, w)"
    is good enough, we need to update comment to show this.

    for a graph we can safely assume that every edge is unique,
    and that every vertex is uniquely distinguished by its name.
    note that these assumption do allow multiple edges between two vertices:
    edges can have extra data to make them different despite that whose
    terminals might be exactly the same.

    adjacency-list form

    - a map from vertices to its neighboring vertices
    - here we modify the presentation a little bit:
      instead of storing neighboring vertices, we store
      neighboring edges.
    - the original adjacency-list form can be recovered easily
    - edges can store more information than vertices
      and actually the origin adjacency-list form fails to
      keep enough information to recover the edge if the edge has
      extra data.
