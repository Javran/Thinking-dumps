{-
    this module leaves the freedom of choosing an edge structure to the user.
    despite of this, the module does provide undirected "Edge" structure, which
    is isomorphic to a pair of vertices.
    since "Edge" in this module is undirected,
    "forall a b. Edge a b == Edge b a" holds.

    note that this module uses "Eq" instance of edge structure to determine
    whether two edges are the same, this means if you are intended to have
    multiple edges between two vertices, you need to have some extra fields
    to make them "look different", that is,
    to make the implementation of Eq take that extra field into account.

    adjacency-list form

    - a map from vertices to its neighboring vertices
    - here we modify the presentation a little bit:
      instead of storing neighboring vertices, we store
      neighboring edges.
    - the original adjacency-list form can be recovered easily
    - edges can store more information than vertices
      and actually the origin adjacency-list form fails to
      keep enough information to recover the edge if the edge has
      extra data.
