\section*{Exercise 3.11}

I extend the language on the top of ``\texttt{eopl3/chapter3/let-lang}'' and
it is already arranged well.

To add new operators, we can change the definition of ``\texttt{the-grammar}''
from file ``\texttt{lang.scm}'' to reflect new grammar.

In addition, to make the new operator work, we modify ``\texttt{value-of}''
from file ``\texttt{interp.scm}'' to implement the new operator.

Furthermore, we can harness the ``\texttt{tests.scm}'' file to test our code
automatically.
