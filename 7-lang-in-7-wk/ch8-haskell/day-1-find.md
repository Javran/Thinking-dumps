## Haskell wiki

There are two websites:

[Haskell Wiki](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell)

[Haskell Wikibooks](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell)

## Compiler supporting team

I can't find supporting teams currently, 
However, Wikipedia has listed [various implementations of haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29#Implementations).

So we can pick the one most suitable.

I'm using [The Glasgow Haskell Compiler](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/).
