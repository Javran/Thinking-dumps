## Clojure function formal definition

If it means how to define a function in clojure:

[Clojure - functional_programming](http://clojure.org/functional_programming#Functional%20Programming--First-class%20functions)

Else if it means the definition of function used in Clojure,
from the document above I guess functions used in Clojure are first-class functions,
we can find the exact definition in wikipedia:

[First-class function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function)

## A script that can run REPL in your environment

I've found `clojure-1.4` located at `/usr/bin/clojure-1.4`,
which can starts a REPL.
(Since my Clojure is provided by package manager).

Another way of starting a REPL is to use `lein`,
of which the project page can be found in 
[github](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).

I can use command `lein repl` to start a repl.
