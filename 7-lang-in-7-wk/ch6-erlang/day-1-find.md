## Official documentation for erlang's function library

Excerpted from [here](http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/functions.html):

*Built-in functions*, BIFs, are implemented in C code in the runtime system 
and do things that are difficult or impossible to implement in Erlang. 
Most of the built-in functions belong to the module `erlang` 
but there are also built-in functions belonging to a few other modules, 
for example `lists` and `ets`.
