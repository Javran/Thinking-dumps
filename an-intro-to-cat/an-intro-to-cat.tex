\subsection{An arrow need not be a function}

\subsubsection{Show that strictly positive integers as objects
and matrices as arrows gives a category}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Objects are strictly positive integers.
  \item Let $m$ and $n$ be two objects, the arrow between them
    ($n \rTo^A m$)
    is an $m \times n$ matrix $A$.
  \item Given two compatible matrices:
    $n \rTo^B k$ and $k \rTo^A m$,
    the arrow composition is given by the matrix product $AB$:
    $n \rTo^{A \fcomp B} m$.
  \item The associativity holds because for any three compatible matrices $A$,$B$ and $C$,
    the matrix multiplication is associative: $(AB)C = A(BC)$.
    Therefore the associativity for arrow composition is obtained from the matrix
    multiplication.
  \item For any object $n$, the identity arrow is the identity matrix $E_n$.
    It holds that $f \fcomp id_n = f = id_m \fcomp f$ for any arrow $f : n \rTo^A m$
    ($A$ is the corresponding matrix of $f$) because of the following property for
    matrix multiplication holds: $ A \times E_n = A = E_m \times A$.
\end{itemize}

Therefore this gives a category. If we have to say that this example somehow cheats,
I think the cheating part is that this category just uses matrix multiplication
to make every property necessary to form a category hold.

\subsubsection{With the appropriate notion of composition,
 graphs and their morphisms form a category}

Suppose we have three directed graphs, namely $(N,E), (M,F), (O,G)$:

\begin{diagram}
  E & \pile{\rTo^{\sigma_0} \\ \rTo_{\tau_0}} & N & \
  F & \pile{\rTo^{\sigma_1} \\ \rTo_{\tau_1}} & M & \
  G & \pile{\rTo^{\sigma_2} \\ \rTo_{\tau_2}} & O & \
\end{diagram}

and two morphisms $f,g$ between them:

\begin{diagram}
  (N,E) & \rTo^f & (M,F) & \rTo^g & (O,G)
\end{diagram}

Graph morphism $f$ consists of two functions $f_0, f_1$, such that:

\begin{align*}
  \sigma_1 \fcomp f_1 = f_0 \fcomp \sigma_0 \qquad \
  \tau_1 \fcomp f_1 = f_0 \fcomp \tau_0
\end{align*}

Similarly, for graph morphism $g$ we have:

\begin{align*}
  \sigma_2 \fcomp g_1 = g_0 \fcomp \sigma_1 \qquad \
  \tau_2 \fcomp f_1 = f_0 \fcomp \tau_1
\end{align*}

Suppose $E_0, F_0, G_0$ are edges in $E,F,G$ respectively
and $N_0 = \sigma_0(E_0), M_0 = \sigma_1(F_0), O_0 = \sigma_2(G_0)$.

We have the following diagram:

\begin{diagram}
  E_0             & \rTo^{f_1} & F_0             & \rTo^{g_1} & G_0 \\
  \dTo^{\sigma_0} &            & \dTo^{\sigma_1} &            & \dTo^{\sigma_2} \\
  N_0             & \rTo^{f_0} & M_0             & \rTo^{g_0} & O_0
\end{diagram}

Since $\sigma_1 \fcomp f_1 = f_0 \fcomp \sigma_0$
and $\sigma_2 \fcomp g_1 = g_0 \fcomp \sigma_1$,
we know that $g_0 \fcomp \sigma_1 \fcomp f_1 = g_0 \fcomp f_0 \fcomp \sigma_0 \
= \sigma_2 \fcomp g_1 \fcomp f_1$.

Similarly, we can conclude that $g_0 \fcomp f_0 \fcomp \tau_0 \
= \tau_2 \fcomp g_1 \fcomp f_1$.

If we denote graph morphisms as pairs of functions, then $f = (f_0,f_1)$ and $g = (g_0,g_1)$.
And we can define the composition of $f$ and $g$ as:

\begin{equation*}
  g \fcomp f = (g_0 \fcomp f_0, g_1 \fcomp f_1)
\end{equation*}

And the composition preserves the property that the following holds:

\begin{align*}
  \sigma_2 \fcomp (g_1 \fcomp f_1) & = (g_0 \fcomp f_0) \fcomp \sigma_0 \\
  \tau_2 \fcomp (g_1 \fcomp f_1) & = (g_0 \fcomp f_0) \fcomp \tau_0
\end{align*}

Therefore we can verify that by taking graphs as objects, graph morphisms as arrows,
and the graph morphism composition defined above as arrow composition, we can form a category.
The associativity of composition holds since:

\begin{align*}
  & (h \fcomp g) \fcomp f \\
  = & ((h_0 \fcomp g_0) \fcomp f_0, (h_1 \fcomp g_1) \fcomp f_1) \\
  = & (h_0 \fcomp (g_0 \fcomp f_0), h_1 \fcomp (g_1 \fcomp f_1)) \\
  = & h \fcomp (g \fcomp f)
\end{align*}

And each identity arrow is the corresponding identity function viewed as graph morphism.

\subsubsection{With the obvious composition this does form a category}

The objects and arrows are given here. So we only need to find a way to compose arrows,
verify its associativity, and find identity arrows.

Consider two new compatible arrows:

\begin{diagram}
  (A,R) & \rTo^{(f,\phi)} & (B,S) & \rTo^{(g,\psi)} & (C,T)
\end{diagram}

where $A,B,C$ are \cat{A}-objects and $R,S,T$ are \cat{S}-objects.

The arrow composition can be defined as:

\begin{align*}
  (g,\psi) \fcomp (f,\phi) = (g \fcomp f, \phi \fcomp \psi)
\end{align*}

We can verify that:

\begin{diagram}
  A & \rTo^{g \fcomp f} & C & R & \lTo^{\phi \fcomp \psi} & T
\end{diagram}

Therefore arrow composition produces another arrow between $(A,R)$ and $(C,T)$.

Given 3 arbitrary compatible arrows $(f,\phi), (g,\psi), (h,\eta)$,
we need to show that the arrow composition is associativity:

\begin{align*}
  & (h,\eta) \fcomp ((g,\psi) \fcomp (f,\phi)) \\
  = & (h,\eta) \fcomp (g \fcomp f, \phi \fcomp \psi) \\
  = & (h \fcomp (g \fcomp f), (\phi \fcomp \psi) \fcomp \eta) \\
  = & ((h \fcomp g) \fcomp f, \phi \fcomp (\psi \fcomp \eta)) \\
  = & (h \fcomp g, \psi \fcomp \eta) \fcomp (f, \phi) \\
  = & ((h,\eta) \fcomp (g,\psi)) \fcomp (f,\phi)
\end{align*}

And each identity arrow is the corresponding pair of identity functions
viewed as a pair of arrows.

\subsubsection{With the obvious composition this does form a category (SetR)}

The arrow composition can be defined in the following way:

For two arbitrary compatible arrows $(f,\phi)$ and $(g,\psi)$, where

\begin{diagram}
  (A,R) & \rTo^{(f,\phi)} & (B,S) & \rTo^{(g,\psi)} & (C,T)
\end{diagram}

The arrow composition is:

\begin{align*}
  (g,\psi) \fcomp (f,\phi) = (g \fcomp f, \phi \fcomp \psi)
\end{align*}

We need to prove that the arrow composition produces an arrow from $(A,R)$ to $(C,T)$,
which has the following property:

\begin{align*}
  \forall a \in A, t \in T, (g \fcomp f)(a (\phi \fcomp \psi)(t)) = \
  (g \fcomp f)(a)t
\end{align*}

\begin{proof}
  The following facts are known:

  \begin{align*}
    \forall a \in A, s \in S, & f(a\phi(s)) = f(a)s \\
    \forall b \in B, t \in T, & g(b\psi(t)) = g(b)t
  \end{align*}

  Since $\psi(t) \in S$, we know that
  $ f(a \phi(\psi(t))) = f(a (\phi \fcomp \psi)(t)) = f(a) \psi(t) $.

  Therefore $\forall a \in A, t \in T$,

  \begin{align*}
    & (g \fcomp f)(a (\phi \fcomp \psi)(t)) \\
    = & g(f(a (\phi \fcomp \psi)(t)) ) \\
    = & g(f(a) \psi(t) ) & f(a) \in B \\
    = & g(f(a))t = (g \fcomp f)(a)t
  \end{align*}

\end{proof}

The associativity of arrow composition holds in the same way that
the arrow composition in exercise $1.3.1$ holds, and each identity arrow
is the corresponding pair of identity functions viewed as an arrow.

Therefore, using the arrow composition decribed above
gives a category.
