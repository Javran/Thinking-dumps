GHC message: https://gist.github.com/Javran/947e853895bfc360ff837a217d076425#file-gistfile1-txt

In short, stuff like

```
Cov.$fFunctorF = GHC.Base.C:Functor @ F $cfmap_a5k7 $c<$_a5l2`
```

should have coverage tick attached:

```
Cov.$fFunctorF = hpc<Cov,X> ...
```

Starting point is `deSugar/Coverage.hs`:

- `addTicksToBinds`:  the pass in Coverage.hs runs *after* generating the derived code.
- `TcGenDeriv`: code generators for things like `deriving (Eq)`
- `TcGenFunctor`: for deriving Functor

Minimal example:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor #-}
module Cov where

newtype F a = F a deriving Functor
```
