In short, stuff like

```
Cov.$fFunctorF = GHC.Base.C:Functor @ F $cfmap_a5k7 $c<$_a5l2`
```

should have coverage tick attached:

```
Cov.$fFunctorF = hpc<Cov,X> ...
```

Starting point is `deSugar/Coverage.hs`:

- `addTicksToBinds`:  the pass in Coverage.hs runs *after* generating the derived code.
- `TcGenDeriv`: code generators for things like `deriving (Eq)`
- `TcGenFunctor`: for deriving Functor

Minimal example:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor #-}
module Cov where

newtype F a = F a deriving Functor
```

Few more ideas:

- looks like there is exactly one pass where ticks get added: `HpcTicks`,
  so even it's `foldr` to allow multiple passes, we only need to look for one.
- Sounds like `addTickLHsBind` is responsible for adding ticks.

But now I'm not sure `Cov.$fFunctorF` is the right place to add coverage.

Even if I implement the instance myself:

```haskell
module Cov where
newtype F a = F a
instance Functor F where
  fmap f (F a) = F (f a)
```

The result looks like:

```
Cov.$fFunctorF [InlPrag=NOUSERINLINE CONLIKE] :: Functor F
[LclIdX[DFunId],
 Unf=DFun: \ -> GHC.Base.C:Functor TYPE: F $cfmap_ask $c<$_asw]
Cov.$fFunctorF = GHC.Base.C:Functor @ F $cfmap_ask $c<$_asw
```

So perhaps what I initially have in mind is wrong?
