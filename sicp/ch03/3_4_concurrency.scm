; functioal programming
; (or we say before we introduce assignments)
;   is timeless.
; after assigments are introduced, same expression
;   might result in different results, which forces us
;   to think time as an essential concept

; concurrent computation:
; * speed advantage
; * better if we can decompose a problem
; into relatively independent pieces
