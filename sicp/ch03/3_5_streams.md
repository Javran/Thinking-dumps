Previous approach: model local states, which changes from time to time.

New approach: behavior is a function of time, `x(t)`,
concentrate on `x` instant by instant,
and the function itself does not change.

Stream: a sequence that uses technique of delayed evaluation.
Let us model a system without assignment and mutable data.
