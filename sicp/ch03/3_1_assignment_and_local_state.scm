; * an object is said to "have state"
;   if its behavior is influenced by its history
; * state variables to characterize an object's state
;   maintain enough information about history to determine
;   the object's current behavior
; * the objects are rarely completely independent
;   the state variables of the system can be grouped into
;   closely coupled subsystems that are only loosely coupled to
;   other subsystems
