These questions are remained unanswered:

* The mechanisms of control in a Lisp system?

** How the evaluation of a subexpression manages to return a value
to the expression that uses this value?

** How some recursive procedures generate iterative processes
whereas other recursive procedures generate recursive processes.

Register machine: executes instructions that manimupate registers
(the contents of a fixed set of storage elements).

A typical instruction applies a primitive operation to the contents
of some registers and assigns the result to another register.
