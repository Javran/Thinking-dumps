Plan

* a standalone version of metacircular evaluator (require as few primitive
defined functions as possible)

* compile it, dump it to a file

* run it

* have a testsuite

  - testcases should be easy, we write expressions
  - and the eval function from the implemented language
    should agree with the one from the implementing language
    the only issue will be the imcompatible environment representation
    need some code to work it out.
