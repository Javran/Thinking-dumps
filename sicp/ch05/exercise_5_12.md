I don't know why these information are
necessary to be stored in the machine itself.
As they have nothing to do with execution and
can be fully inferred from controller text.

Therefore I will write a module that can be shared
between two simulators. The module will do the analysis
and results can be stored
in the corresponding machine structure.
