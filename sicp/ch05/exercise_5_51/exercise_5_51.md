# Plans for implementing the explicit-control evaluator

I guess I will be implementing the evaluator in C.

Few things to be investigated:

* yacc and lex, could be necessary when implementing "read"
also we need it for parsing the expression

* Makefile, could be helpful

* garbage collection (might not be necessary)

* high precision lib (could be one of the feature xD)
