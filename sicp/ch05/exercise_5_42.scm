;; NOTE: for the idea of lexical addressing
;; to be applicable here, we assume there is no "non-top-level"
;; definitions
;; This means the following expression will not work under
;; our new evaluator:
;; ((lambda (x y)
;;    (define z 17)
;;    (define t 23)
;;    (- z x t y))
;;  11
;;  100)
;; the reason is because that definitions will call "add-binding-to-frame"
;; function to manipulate the frame. the binding is added
;; in front of the existing bindings of that frame,
;; which makes the runtime environment and compile-time environment
;; out-of-sync. A potential fix would be to make "add-binding-to-frame"
;; insert in the back of the frame.

;; However, if we allow only the top-level definitions,
;; our lexical addressing strategy will still work.
;; The important point here is that: if the program is correct,
;; but the compile time environment fails to find the variable
;; this can only mean that the variable is a top-level definition,
;; so we can just try to lookup it in the global environment
;; instead of traversing all layers of frames to go to there.

;; NOTE: in this version of the compiler,
;; non-top level definitions are not allowed.
;; i.e. you are not allowed to use "define" forms
;; inside "begin"/"lambda" or even the body of "define"
;; see the comments above for details
