No idea for now. Maybe some techniqbue from exercise 5.17 might be helpful.
The approach described by the exercise has a tiny drawback that
we cannot set breakpoint if there is no label before the intended instruction.
But this is easy to fix and we can always add a dummy label right before the first instruction.
