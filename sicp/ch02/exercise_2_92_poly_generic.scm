; notice that once we have `first-term` `rest-terms` `empty?`
; we can access the termlist without knowing the underlying type.
; moreover, if we have `adjoin-term`, then `add-terms` becomes possible
; respect this idea, I'll collect some procedure makers here.
; so that when the required methods can be founded, we can make handlers
; with little pain by simply call the procedure to make one for us.
