To apply a rule, first use ordinary pattern matching
to see if any assertion can be applied.

And then attempt to unify the query pattern with the conclusion
of each rule.

And successful match produces frames.
(I guess frames are just equivalent to "some informations about binding variables"
in the high level idea)
