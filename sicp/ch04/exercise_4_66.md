Ben's accumulation scheme won't work correctly.
Consider the result from previous exercise:
when doing statistics about wheels, Ben's accumulation
scheme will wrongly take a single person as multiple
person because of the duplication in the querying result.
To salvage the situation, Ben need to have a function
that can eliminate duplicated elements to ensure the
uniqueness of people before doing statistics.
