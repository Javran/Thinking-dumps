(Maybe this part is intended to be written in a way
that I don't understand any piece of it, and no source code
is available for reference.
And we have to go back and forth to get myself understood.

Let's don't pay that much attention for these high level ideas for now.
I prefer to see the implementation first.)

Unification is a generalization of pattern matching.
"pattern" and "datum" may contain variables.

Seems "unifier" is the one that does unification,
and the unifier is also working with frames.
(however no description about what exactly will be contained
in the frame is still not mentioned anywhere...)
