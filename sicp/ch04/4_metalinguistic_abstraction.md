# Multitude of languages

* physical languages: the representation of data and control
in terms of individual bits of storage and primitive machine
instructions

* higher-level languages: combination and abstraction that
are appropriate to the larger-scale of systems

# Metalinguistic abstraction

Formulate new languages and implement these
languages by constructing evaluators(or interpreters).
