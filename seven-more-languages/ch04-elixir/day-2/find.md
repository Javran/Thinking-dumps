## `elixir-pipes` GitHub project

TODO: the implementation looks simple but without some basics about Marco module and
the representation of elixir expressions, I don't think I'm ready for answering this question.
Will come back later after completing some actually programming exercises.

## The supported Elixir module attributes

* An introduction about Elixir module attributes can be found [here](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/module-attributes.html)
  which has frequently used attributes: `@moduledoc`, `@doc`, `@behavior`, `@before_compile`.

* A complete list of supported module attributes (those that has special meanings to Elixir) can be found [here](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/v1.0/elixir/Module.html)
