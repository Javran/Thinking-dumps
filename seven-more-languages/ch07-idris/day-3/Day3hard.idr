module Day3Hard

-- this module is just a placeholder,
-- see Proof.idr, which contains the complete proof.

-- some notes: keep holes in right hand side of a definition,
-- you'll see errors like the following:
{-
*Proof> :p plusZero
Declarations not solvable using prover
-}
-- I don't know the exact reason, but it seems toplevel holes cannot be used
-- as a proof goal.
