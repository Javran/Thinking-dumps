* How do you compile an Elm program?

    To compile an Elm program without any dependencies, `elm-make` (or `elm make`) is good enough.
    But if you want to use packages, you will need to create a project first using `elm package install`.
    After this step is done, install any packages you want to use.
    Finally you can use `elm make <source files>` to compile and generate `.html` or `.js` files.
