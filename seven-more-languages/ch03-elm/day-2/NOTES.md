**Inversion of control** is a different style of programming.
What we usually expect is that an external library provides operations
that we can call to implement certain functionalities. Instead of doing so,
sometimes a library function takes functions as input, and transfers control to
it when the proper time comes.

At this point I want to abort using Elm. Thanks to the frequent change of APIs and concepts,
it's really hard to track changes made from 0.13 to the current version:
documentation about how to adjust your code can be found nowhere,
and you will get more frustrated looking at Elm's commit log on GitHub: renaming happens everywhere.
It's a rather unstable programming language I should say, and I believe quiting is the best choice.
