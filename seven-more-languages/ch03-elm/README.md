Keep in mind that Elm is constantly changing.

Right now Elm has reached its 0.16.0 version, and lots of breaking changes have been made
since the publication of the book (the demo version is 0.13 in the book).

I'll try to follow this chapter and see how things work out.
Will note about changes if I feel necessary.

Some changes can be found in [the Changelog of Elm core package](https://github.com/elm-lang/core/blob/master/changelog.md)

# Directories

Notes and exercise answers are under `day-x` directories.
`my-package` will be a single project for all programming exercises.
Under `my-package`, `src/Main.elm` will be the entry.
