# Persistence

* Functional data structure does not destroy the existing version,
  instead, it creates a new version of it.

* Since nodes are not mutated, they can be shared between many versions of the same
  data structure.

## Lists (2.1)

Basic operations:

* `cons h t` (or `h : t`) prepends `h` in front of `t`
* `head xs` gets the head of a non-empty list
* `tail xs` gets the tail of a non-empty list
* `empty` (or `[]`) creates an empty list
* `isEmpty xs` tests emptiness of a list `xs`

**List concatenation `(++)`** is usually implemented by destructing its first argument:

```haskell
(++) xs ys = case xs of
  [] -> ys
  (a:as) -> a : (++) as ys
```

One observation of this implementation is that while `xs` is destructed
and traversed (doing so causes the $O(n)$ time complexity),
`ys` is not touched at all. say if `zs = xs ++ ys`,
then `ys` will be shared to `zs` as its "subtree".

**List update function `update`** can be implemented in the following way:

```haskell
update [] i y = error "subscript"
update (x:xs) 0 y = y : xs
update (x:xs) i y = x : update xs (i-1) y
```

So `update` does not destroy the old list, instead, it copies all nodes
on the path from root to the one we want to update, but rest of
the nodes are shared between old and new one.

## Binary Search Trees (2.2)

A BST is a binary tree with the following property:

- for any node in the tree:
    - if it is a non-leaf node, then it contains an element `v`
    - all elements of its left subtree are less than `v`
    - all elements of its right subtree are greater than `v`

Notes:

* This implies elements must support total order.
* No duplicate elements: suppose we want to insert
  something that already exists, it either inserts
  recursively to left or right node, or dropped because
  it is equal to the current node.

In addition to all operations supported by binary trees, it has two operations:

* `member v set`: tests if `v` is a member of `set`.
* `insert v set`: inserts `v` into `set`.

Both membership test and insertion are done by traversing down the tree,
comparing nodes in the way to decide either going recursively to one of the subtrees
or stop if an element is found.
