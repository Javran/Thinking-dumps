# Fundamentals of Amortization

Idea: bound the total running time while allowing some expensive operations to happen.
(In some wrose-case time complexity analysis, the worse case might be consisting of
a sequence of expensive operations. But normally this bound is not practical because
expensive operations do not happen frequently.)
