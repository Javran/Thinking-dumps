# Fundamentals of Amortization

Idea: bound the total running time while allowing some expensive operations to happen.
(In some wrose-case time complexity analysis, the worse case might be consisting of
a sequence of expensive operations. But normally this bound is not practical because
expensive operations do not happen frequently.)

We define **the amortized cost** of each operation and then proves that.
And the total amortized cost of the operations is an upper bound on total actual cost.

**Accumulated savings**: the difference between the accumulated amortized costs
and the accumulated actual costs

**Expensive** operations: those (occasionally happened) operations that have their actual costs
exceed their amortized costs.

Two (equivalent) techniques for analyzing amortized data structures:

- Banker's method: assigning **credits** to individual locations in the data structure for "paying" future cost of accessing these locations.

    - **credit invariant**: usually states that when an expensive operation happens,
      there's always enough credit to pay for it.

- Physicist's method: define a function that maps each object to a real number (called **potential** of that object)

    - the function usually assigns initial potential to zero and is always non-negative
    - potential represents a lower bound on the accumulated savings
