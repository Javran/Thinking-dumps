# Some Familar Data Structues in a Functional Setting

* Sometimes all we want is the minimum element of a collection
  (we might want the maximum, and to achieve so we just need to flip
  the `<` relation.)
* **priority queue** or **heap** is the name of data structures that
  have this support.
* **heap-ordered** trees: a tree whose element at each node
  is no larger than the elements at its children.
* Under this ordering, the minimum element in a tree is always at the root.

## Leftist Heap (3.1)

* heap-ordered binary trees
* satisfies **leftist property**
* **leftist property**: the rank of any left child is at least
  as large as the rank of its right sibling
* The **rank** of a node is defined to be the length of
  its **right spine**.
* the **right spine** of a node is the rightmost path (always taking the right path)
  from this node to an empty node.
