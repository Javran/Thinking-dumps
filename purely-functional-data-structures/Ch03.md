# Some Familar Data Structues in a Functional Setting

* Sometimes all we want is the minimum element of a collection
  (we might want the maximum, and to achieve so we just need to flip
  the `<` relation.)
* **priority queue** or **heap** is the name of data structures that
  have this support.
* **heap-ordered** trees: a tree whose element at each node
  is no larger than the elements at its children.
* Note that **heap-ordered** does not say anything about the relation between
  left and right children of a tree, only that the minimum one should be the
  parent of both. So this ordering is some sense "more loose" than a binary search tree.
* Under this ordering, the minimum element in a tree is always at the root.

## Leftist Heap (3.1)

* heap-ordered binary trees
* satisfies **leftist property**
* **leftist property**: the rank of any left child is at least
  as large as the rank of its right sibling
* The **rank** of a node is defined to be the length of its **right spine**.
  (an empty node has rank of 0)
* the **right spine** of a node is the rightmost path (always taking the right path)
  from this node to an empty node.

Notes:

* the conclusion of exercise 3.1 says that in a leftist tree,
  the right spine of the root is always "small".
* the basic operation for a leftist tree is `merge`, which
  only walks through right spine of some nodes, which
  bounds the time complexity to $O(\log(n))$
* while the empty node has rank 0, a singleton tree has rank 1 (see `insert` function in book).
  So if a node is newly inserted to a right tree while left tree is empty,
  this node will be moved to the left tree in order to keep the leftist property.

## Binominal Heap (3.2)

Primitive object : binominal tree

* A binominal tree of rank 0 is a singleton node
* A binominal tree of rank $r+1$ is formed by linking two binominal trees of rank $r$,
  making one tree the leftmost child of the other.

Alternative definition:

* A binominal tree of rank 0 is a singleton node
* A binominal tree of rank $r$ is a node with $r$ children $t_1 \ldots t_r$,
  where each $t_i$ is a binominal tree of rank $r-i$.

A binominal heap is a collection of heap-ordered binominal trees in which no two trees
have the same rank.

Notes:

* the definition implies that a binominal tree of rank $r$
  should have exactly $2^r$ nodes in it
* the trees in a binominal heap of size $n$ correspond exactly to the ones in the
  binary representation of $n$.
