# Lazy Evaluation

- Evaluation of a given expression is suspeneded (not fully evaluated)
- When a suspended expression is evaluated, it's result is memoized (stored) so
  any future evaluation of it returns immediately when the stored value.

`$` notation in book:

- the scope of it extends as far to the right as possible. (e.g. `$f x` means `$(f x)`, not `$(f) x`)
- to get the value back we need to pattern matching against it (e.g. `force ($x) = x`)
- sometimes the strictness is not desired. for example: `plus ($m,$n) = $m+n` forces `m` and `n` before `+` is called. to delaying the forcing, we can do: `plus (x,y) = $case (x,y) of ($m,$n) -> m+n`. a shorthand of this is: `lazy plus ($m,$n) = $m+n` (think about Haskell's lazy pattern!)
