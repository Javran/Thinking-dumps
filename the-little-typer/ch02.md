## Chapter 2

An eliminator:

- "takes apart the values built by constructors"
- "allows that information (what value contains) to be used."

The only way to eliminate a lambda (function) is through application.

Expressions that are not values and cannoy **yet** be evaluated due to
a variable are called **neutral**.

Neutral expressions that are written identically are the same, no matter their type.

`which-Nat` is an eliminator for `Nat`.

Note: shouldn't `which-Nat` have a type? Probably `forall X. (-> Nat X (-> Nat X) X)`?
