## Chapter 1

The four forms of judgment:

- `X` is a `Y`
- `X` is the same `<type>` as `Y`
- `X` is a type
- `X` and `Y` are the same type.

Note how non-type comparisons have to specify a type.

"Normal form" is "the most direct way of writing it", and we can't talk about normal form
without specifying its type.

Note: I'm not sure how to interpret this, however:

- Does type provide a baked in notion of normalization?

- Or we are just making the distinction between well-formed and ill-formed:

    + a well-formed expression has a type (and normalization)
    + an ill-formed one doesn't have a type, let alone normalization.

An expression with a constructor at the top is called **a value**.
Note that it is not required that a value must be in normal form - sort of like the concept of "weak head normal form" in Haskell.

In Pie, there is nothing but expressions and what we judge about them.

A normal expression "has no remaining opportunities for evaluation".
