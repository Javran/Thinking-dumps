(** * The [apply] Tactic *)

(** We often encounter situations where the goal to be proved is
    exactly the same as some hypothesis in the context or some
    previously proved lemma. *)

Theorem silly1 : forall (n m o p : nat),
     n = m  ->
     [n;o] = [n;p] ->
     [n;o] = [m;p].
Proof.
  intros n m o p eq1 eq2.
  rewrite <- eq1.
  (* At this point, we could finish with 
     "[rewrite -> eq2. reflexivity.]" as we have 
     done several times above. But we can achieve the
     same effect in a single step by using the 
     [apply] tactic instead: *)
  apply eq2.  Qed.

(** The [apply] tactic also works with _conditional_ hypotheses
    and lemmas: if the statement being applied is an implication, then
    the premises of this implication will be added to the list of
    subgoals needing to be proved. *)

Theorem silly2 : forall (n m o p : nat),
     n = m  ->
     (forall (q r : nat), q = r -> [q;o] = [r;p]) ->
     [n;o] = [m;p].
Proof.
  intros n m o p eq1 eq2. 
  apply eq2. apply eq1.  Qed.

(** You may find it instructive to experiment with this proof
    and see if there is a way to complete it using just [rewrite]
    instead of [apply]. *)

(** Typically, when we use [apply H], the statement [H] will
    begin with a [forall] binding some _universal variables_.  When
    Coq matches the current goal against the conclusion of [H], it
    will try to find appropriate values for these variables.  For
    example, when we do [apply eq2] in the following proof, the
    universal variable [q] in [eq2] gets instantiated with [n] and [r]
    gets instantiated with [m]. *)

Theorem silly2a : forall (n m : nat),
     (n,n) = (m,m)  ->
     (forall (q r : nat), (q,q) = (r,r) -> [q] = [r]) ->
     [n] = [m].
Proof.
  intros n m eq1 eq2.
  apply eq2. apply eq1.  Qed.

(** To use the [apply] tactic, the (conclusion of the) fact
    being applied must match the goal _exactly_ -- for example, [apply]
    will not work if the left and right sides of the equality are
    swapped. *)

Theorem silly3_firsttry : forall (n : nat),
     true = beq_nat n 5  ->
     beq_nat (S (S n)) 7 = true.

  intros n H.

(** In this case we can use the [symmetry] tactic, which switches the
    left and right sides of an equality in the goal. *)

(** * The [apply ... with ...] Tactic *)

(** The following silly example uses two rewrites in a row to
    get from [[a,b]] to [[e,f]]. *)

Example trans_eq_example : forall (a b c d e f : nat),
     [a;b] = [c;d] ->
     [c;d] = [e;f] ->
     [a;b] = [e;f].
Proof.
  intros a b c d e f eq1 eq2. 
  rewrite -> eq1. rewrite -> eq2. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Since this is a common pattern, we might
    abstract it out as a lemma recording once and for all
    the fact that equality is transitive. *)

Theorem trans_eq : forall (X:Type) (n m o : X),
  n = m -> m = o -> n = o.
Proof.
  intros X n m o eq1 eq2. rewrite -> eq1. rewrite -> eq2. 
  reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Now, we should be able to use [trans_eq] to
    prove the above example.  However, to do this we need
    a slight refinement of the [apply] tactic. *)

Example trans_eq_example' : forall (a b c d e f : nat),
     [a;b] = [c;d] ->
     [c;d] = [e;f] ->
     [a;b] = [e;f].
Proof.
  intros a b c d e f eq1 eq2. 
  (* If we simply tell Coq [apply trans_eq] at this point,
     it can tell (by matching the goal against the
     conclusion of the lemma) that it should instantiate [X]
     with [[nat]], [n] with [[a,b]], and [o] with [[e,f]].
     However, the matching process doesn't determine an
     instantiation for [m]: we have to supply one explicitly
     by adding [with (m:=[c,d])] to the invocation of
     [apply]. *)
  apply trans_eq with (m:=[c;d]). apply eq1. apply eq2.   Qed.

(**  Actually, we usually don't have to include the name [m]
    in the [with] clause; Coq is often smart enough to
    figure out which instantiation we're giving. We could
    instead write: [apply trans_eq with [c,d]]. *)

(** * The [inversion] tactic *)

(** Recall the definition of natural numbers:
     Inductive nat : Type :=
       | O : nat
       | S : nat -> nat.
    It is clear from this definition that every number has one of two
    forms: either it is the constructor [O] or it is built by applying
    the constructor [S] to another number.  But there is more here than
    meets the eye: implicit in the definition (and in our informal
    understanding of how datatype declarations work in other
    programming languages) are two other facts:

    - The constructor [S] is _injective_.  That is, the only way we can
      have [S n = S m] is if [n = m].

    - The constructors [O] and [S] are _disjoint_.  That is, [O] is not
      equal to [S n] for any [n]. *)

(** Similar principles apply to all inductively defined types: all
    constructors are injective, and the values built from distinct
    constructors are never equal.  For lists, the [cons] constructor is
    injective and [nil] is different from every non-empty list.  For
    booleans, [true] and [false] are unequal.  (Since neither [true]
    nor [false] take any arguments, their injectivity is not an issue.) *)

(** Coq provides a tactic called [inversion] that allows us to exploit
    these principles in proofs.
 
    The [inversion] tactic is used like this.  Suppose [H] is a
    hypothesis in the context (or a previously proven lemma) of the
    form
      c a1 a2 ... an = d b1 b2 ... bm
    for some constructors [c] and [d] and arguments [a1 ... an] and
    [b1 ... bm].  Then [inversion H] instructs Coq to "invert" this
    equality to extract the information it contains about these terms:

    - If [c] and [d] are the same constructor, then we know, by the
      injectivity of this constructor, that [a1 = b1], [a2 = b2],
      etc.; [inversion H] adds these facts to the context, and tries
      to use them to rewrite the goal.

    - If [c] and [d] are different constructors, then the hypothesis
      [H] is contradictory.  That is, a false assumption has crept
      into the context, and this means that any goal whatsoever is
      provable!  In this case, [inversion H] marks the current goal as
      completed and pops it off the goal stack. *)

(** The [inversion] tactic is probably easier to understand by
    seeing it in action than from general descriptions like the above.
    Below you will find example theorems that demonstrate the use of
    [inversion] and exercises to test your understanding. *)

     n = m.

(** While the injectivity of constructors allows us to reason

(** Here's another illustration of [inversion].  This is a slightly

    recently. *)

(* ###################################################### *)
(** * Using Tactics on Hypotheses *)

(** By default, most tactics work on the goal formula and leave
    the context unchanged.  However, most tactics also have a variant
    that performs a similar operation on a statement in the context.

    For example, the tactic [simpl in H] performs simplification in
    the hypothesis named [H] in the context. *)

Theorem S_inj : forall (n m : nat) (b : bool),
     beq_nat (S n) (S m) = b  ->
     beq_nat n m = b. 
Proof.
  intros n m b H. simpl in H. apply H.  Qed.

(** Similarly, the tactic [apply L in H] matches some
    conditional statement [L] (of the form [L1 -> L2], say) against a
    hypothesis [H] in the context.  However, unlike ordinary
    [apply] (which rewrites a goal matching [L2] into a subgoal [L1]),
    [apply L in H] matches [H] against [L1] and, if successful,
    replaces it with [L2].
 
    In other words, [apply L in H] gives us a form of "forward
    reasoning" -- from [L1 -> L2] and a hypothesis matching [L1], it
    gives us a hypothesis matching [L2].  By contrast, [apply L] is
    "backward reasoning" -- it says that if we know [L1->L2] and we
    are trying to prove [L2], it suffices to prove [L1].  

    Here is a variant of a proof from above, using forward reasoning
    throughout instead of backward reasoning. *)

Theorem silly3' : forall (n : nat),
  (beq_nat n 5 = true -> beq_nat (S (S n)) 7 = true) ->
     true = beq_nat n 5  ->
     true = beq_nat (S (S n)) 7.
Proof.
  intros n eq H.
  symmetry in H. apply eq in H. symmetry in H. 
  apply H.  Qed.

(** Forward reasoning starts from what is _given_ (premises,
    previously proven theorems) and iteratively draws conclusions from
    them until the goal is reached.  Backward reasoning starts from
    the _goal_, and iteratively reasons about what would imply the
    goal, until premises or previously proven theorems are reached.
    If you've seen informal proofs before (for example, in a math or
    computer science class), they probably used forward reasoning.  In
    general, Coq tends to favor backward reasoning, but in some
    situations the forward style can be easier to use or to think
    about.  *)

(** * Varying the Induction Hypothesis *)

(** Sometimes it is important to control the exact form of the
    induction hypothesis when carrying out inductive proofs in Coq.
    In particular, we need to be careful about which of the
    assumptions we move (using [intros]) from the goal to the context
    before invoking the [induction] tactic.  For example, suppose 
    we want to show that the [double] function is injective -- i.e., 
    that it always maps different arguments to different results:  
    Theorem double_injective: forall n m, double n = double m -> n = m. 
    The way we _start_ this proof is a little bit delicate: if we 
    begin it with
      intros n. induction n.
]] 
    all is well.  But if we begin it with
      intros n m. induction n.
    we get stuck in the middle of the inductive case... *)

Theorem double_injective_FAILED : forall n m,
     double n = double m ->
     n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m. induction n as [| n'].
  Case "n = O". simpl. intros eq. destruct m as [| m'].
    SCase "m = O". reflexivity.
    SCase "m = S m'". inversion eq. 
  Case "n = S n'". intros eq. destruct m as [| m'].
    SCase "m = O". inversion eq.
    SCase "m = S m'".  apply f_equal. 
      (* Here we are stuck.  The induction hypothesis, [IHn'], does
         not give us [n' = m'] -- there is an extra [S] in the
         way -- so the goal is not provable. *)
      Abort.

(** What went wrong? *)

(** The problem is that, at the point we invoke the induction
    hypothesis, we have already introduced [m] into the context -- 
    intuitively, we have told Coq, "Let's consider some particular
    [n] and [m]..." and we now have to prove that, if [double n =
    double m] for _this particular_ [n] and [m], then [n = m].

    The next tactic, [induction n] says to Coq: We are going to show
    the goal by induction on [n].  That is, we are going to prove that
    the proposition

      - [P n]  =  "if [double n = double m], then [n = m]"

    holds for all [n] by showing

      - [P O]              

         (i.e., "if [double O = double m] then [O = m]")

      - [P n -> P (S n)]  

        (i.e., "if [double n = double m] then [n = m]" implies "if
        [double (S n) = double m] then [S n = m]").

    If we look closely at the second statement, it is saying something
    rather strange: it says that, for a _particular_ [m], if we know

      - "if [double n = double m] then [n = m]"

    then we can prove

       - "if [double (S n) = double m] then [S n = m]".

    To see why this is strange, let's think of a particular [m] --
    say, [5].  The statement is then saying that, if we know

      - [Q] = "if [double n = 10] then [n = 5]"

    then we can prove

      - [R] = "if [double (S n) = 10] then [S n = 5]".

    But knowing [Q] doesn't give us any help with proving [R]!  (If we
    tried to prove [R] from [Q], we would say something like "Suppose
    [double (S n) = 10]..." but then we'd be stuck: knowing that
    [double (S n)] is [10] tells us nothing about whether [double n]
    is [10], so [Q] is useless at this point.) *)

(** To summarize: Trying to carry out this proof by induction on [n]
    when [m] is already in the context doesn't work because we are
    trying to prove a relation involving _every_ [n] but just a
    _single_ [m]. *)

(** The good proof of [double_injective] leaves [m] in the goal
    statement at the point where the [induction] tactic is invoked on
    [n]: *)

         the induction, this is perfect: if we
         instantiate the generic [m] in the IH with the
         [m'] that we are talking about right now (this

  - First, suppose [m = 0], and suppose [n] is a number such
    that [double n = double m].  We must show that [n = 0].

    Since [m = 0], by the definition of [double] we have [double n =
    0].  There are two cases to consider for [n].  If [n = 0] we are
    done, since this is what we wanted to show.  Otherwise, if [n = S
    n'] for some [n'], we derive a contradiction: by the definition of
    [double] we would have [double n = S (S (double n'))], but this
    contradicts the assumption that [double n = 0].

  - Otherwise, suppose [m = S m'] and that [n] is again a number such
    that [double n = double m].  We must show that [n = S m'], with
    the induction hypothesis that for every number [s], if [double s =
    double m'] then [s = m'].
 
    By the fact that [m = S m'] and the definition of [double], we
    have [double n = S (S (double m'))].  There are two cases to
    consider for [n].

    If [n = 0], then by definition [double n = 0], a contradiction.
    Thus, we may assume that [n = S n'] for some [n'], and again by
    the definition of [double] we have [S (S (double n')) = S (S
    (double m'))], which implies by inversion that [double n' = double
    m'].

    Instantiating the induction hypothesis with [n'] thus allows us to
    conclude that [n' = m'], and it follows immediately that [S n' = S
    m'].  Since [S n' = n] and [S m' = m], this is just what we wanted
    to show. [] *)

(** * Using [destruct] on Compound Expressions *)

(** We have seen many examples where the [destruct] tactic is
    used to perform case analysis of the value of some variable.  But
    sometimes we need to reason by cases on the result of some
    _expression_.  We can also do this with [destruct].

    Here are some examples: *)

Definition sillyfun (n : nat) : bool :=
  if beq_nat n 3 then false
  else if beq_nat n 5 then false
  else false.

Theorem sillyfun_false : forall (n : nat),
  sillyfun n = false.
Proof.
  intros n. unfold sillyfun. 
  destruct (beq_nat n 3).
    Case "beq_nat n 3 = true". reflexivity.
    Case "beq_nat n 3 = false". destruct (beq_nat n 5).
      SCase "beq_nat n 5 = true". reflexivity.
      SCase "beq_nat n 5 = false". reflexivity.  Qed.

(** After unfolding [sillyfun] in the above proof, we find that
    we are stuck on [if (beq_nat n 3) then ... else ...].  Well,
    either [n] is equal to [3] or it isn't, so we use [destruct
    (beq_nat n 3)] to let us reason about the two cases. 

    In general, the [destruct] tactic can be used to perform case
    analysis of the results of arbitrary computations.  If [e] is an
    expression whose type is some inductively defined type [T], then,
    for each constructor [c] of [T], [destruct e] generates a subgoal
    in which all occurrences of [e] (in the goal and in the context)
    are replaced by [c].

*)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star (override_shadow) *)
Theorem override_shadow : forall (X:Type) x1 x2 k1 k2 (f : nat->X),

  split l = (l1, l2) ->
  combine l1 l2 = l.
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** Sometimes, doing a [destruct] on a compound expression (a
    non-variable) will erase information we need to complete a proof. *)
(** For example, suppose
    we define a function [sillyfun1] like this: *)

Definition sillyfun1 (n : nat) : bool :=
  if beq_nat n 3 then true
  else if beq_nat n 5 then true
  else false.

(** And suppose that we want to convince Coq of the rather
    obvious observation that [sillyfun1 n] yields [true] only when [n]
    is odd.  By analogy with the proofs we did with [sillyfun] above,
    it is natural to start the proof like this: *)

Theorem sillyfun1_odd_FAILED : forall (n : nat),
     sillyfun1 n = true ->
     oddb n = true.
Proof.
  intros n eq. unfold sillyfun1 in eq.
  destruct (beq_nat n 3).
  (* stuck... *)
Abort.

(** We get stuck at this point because the context does not
    contain enough information to prove the goal!  The problem is that
    the substitution peformed by [destruct] is too brutal -- it threw
    away every occurrence of [beq_nat n 3], but we need to keep some
    memory of this expression and how it was destructed, because we
    need to be able to reason that since, in this branch of the case
    analysis, [beq_nat n 3 = true], it must be that [n = 3], from
    which it follows that [n] is odd.

    What we would really like is to substitute away all existing
    occurences of [beq_nat n 3], but at the same time add an equation
    to the context that records which case we are in.  The [eqn:]
    qualifier allows us to introduce such an equation (with whatever
    name we choose). *)

Theorem sillyfun1_odd : forall (n : nat),
     sillyfun1 n = true ->
     oddb n = true.
Proof.
  intros n eq. unfold sillyfun1 in eq.
  destruct (beq_nat n 3) eqn:Heqe3.
  (* Now we have the same state as at the point where we got stuck
    above, except that the context contains an extra equality
    assumption, which is exactly what we need to make progress. *)
    Case "e3 = true". apply beq_nat_true in Heqe3.
      rewrite -> Heqe3. reflexivity.
    Case "e3 = false".
     (* When we come to the second equality test in the body of the
       function we are reasoning about, we can use [eqn:] again in the
       same way, allow us to finish the proof. *)
      destruct (beq_nat n 5) eqn:Heqe5. 
        SCase "e5 = true".
          apply beq_nat_true in Heqe5.
          rewrite -> Heqe5. reflexivity.

(** * Review *)

(** We've now seen a bunch of Coq's fundamental tactics.  We'll
    introduce a few more as we go along through the coming lectures,
    and later in the course we'll introduce some more powerful
    _automation_ tactics that make Coq do more of the low-level work
    in many cases.  But basically we've got what we need to get work
    done.

    Here are the ones we've seen:

      - [intros]: 
        move hypotheses/variables from goal to context 

      - [reflexivity]:
        finish the proof (when the goal looks like [e = e])

      - [apply]:
        prove goal using a hypothesis, lemma, or constructor

      - [apply... in H]: 
        apply a hypothesis, lemma, or constructor to a hypothesis in
        the context (forward reasoning)

      - [apply... with...]:
        explicitly specify values for variables that cannot be
        determined by pattern matching

      - [simpl]:
        simplify computations in the goal 

      - [simpl in H]:
        ... or a hypothesis 

      - [rewrite]:
        use an equality hypothesis (or lemma) to rewrite the goal 

      - [rewrite ... in H]:
        ... or a hypothesis 

      - [symmetry]:
        changes a goal of the form [t=u] into [u=t]

      - [symmetry in H]:
        changes a hypothesis of the form [t=u] into [u=t]

      - [unfold]:
        replace a defined constant by its right-hand side in the goal 

      - [unfold... in H]:
        ... or a hypothesis  

      - [destruct... as...]:
        case analysis on values of inductively defined types 

      - [destruct... eqn:...]:
        specify the name of an equation to be added to the context,
        recording the result of the case analysis

      - [induction... as...]:
        induction on values of inductively defined types 

      - [inversion]:
        reason by injectivity and distinctness of constructors

      - [assert (e) as H]:
        introduce a "local lemma" [e] and call it [H] 

      - [generalize dependent x]:
        move the variable [x] (and anything else that depends on it)
        from the context back to an explicit hypothesis in the goal
        formula
