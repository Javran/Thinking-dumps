# Software Foundations

* The book can be found [here](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/)

* While the Coq source files is well self-documented, I'll try to
finish exercises by just modifying these source codes

* More information will be available as I explore more about this book

* The first commit contains just a copy of all source codes as a starting point,
the problem is that the book contents takes a large proportion but what's new
is merely related to exercises.

* You might compare the first commit in this branch with the latest one,
to find out what I've done so far.

* TODO: I should better contain stuffs as necessary, rather than copy
everything here which makes the source code verbose.
