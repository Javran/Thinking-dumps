       - Several optional chapters of _Software Foundations_ 

       - Cutting-edge conferences on programming languages and formal
         verification:
            - POPL
            - PLDI
            - OOPSLA
            - ICFP
            - CAV
            - (and many others)

            - Learn You a Haskell for Great Good, by Miran
              Lipovaca (ebook)
            - and many other texts on Haskell, OCaml, Scheme, Scala, ...

       - More on Hoare logic and program verification

              Introduction, by Glynn Winskel.  MIT Press, 1993.
            - Many practical verification tools, e.g. Microsoft's
              Boogie system, Java Extended Static Checking, etc.

       - More on the foundations of programming languages:
            - Types and Programming Languages, by Benjamin C. Pierce. MIT
              Press, 2002.
            - Practical Foundations for Programming Languages, by Robert
              Harper.  Forthcoming from MIT Press.  Manuscript available
              from his web page.
            - Foundations for Programming Languages, by John C. Mitchell.
              MIT Press, 1996. 
 
       - More on Coq: 
           - Certified Programming with Dependent Types, by Adam
             Chlipala.  A draft textbook on practical proof
             engineering with Coq, available from his web page.

             Bertot and Pierre Casteran.  Springer-Verlag, 2004.
           - Iron Lambda (http://iron.ouroborus.net/) is a collection
             of ​Coq formalisations for functional languages of
             increasing complexity. It fills part of the gap between
             the end of the​ Software Foundations course and what
             appears in current research papers.  The collection has
             at least Progress and Preservation theorems for a number
             of variants of STLC and the polymorphic
             lambda-calculus (System F)
