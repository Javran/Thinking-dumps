If you are taking a course that uses this material, please leave immediately.
The solutions and notes here are kept only for myself
and perhaps for those self-learners to reference.

Despite having "Do not distribute solutions publicly" reminder,
there has been many solutions around and I don't think it can do any more damage adding my own.
But if it does hurt, please let me know. I'll probably swtich to a private repo or something.
