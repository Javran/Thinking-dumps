(** * Logic: Logic in Coq *)

Require Export MoreProp. 

(** Coq's built-in logic is very small: the only primitives are
    [Inductive] definitions, universal quantification ([forall]), and
    implication ([->]), while all the other familiar logical
    connectives -- conjunction, disjunction, negation, existential
    quantification, even equality -- can be encoded using just these.

    This chapter explains the encodings and shows how the tactics
    we've seen can be used to carry out standard forms of logical
    reasoning involving these connectives. *)

(* ########################################################### *)
(** * Conjunction *)

(** The logical conjunction of propositions [P] and [Q] can be
    represented using an [Inductive] definition with one
    constructor. *)

Inductive and (P Q : Prop) : Prop :=
  conj : P -> Q -> (and P Q). 

(** Note that, like the definition of [ev] in a previous
    chapter, this definition is parameterized; however, in this case,
    the parameters are themselves propositions, rather than numbers. *)

(** The intuition behind this definition is simple: to
    construct evidence for [and P Q], we must provide evidence
    for [P] and evidence for [Q].  More precisely:

    - [conj p q] can be taken as evidence for [and P Q] if [p]
      is evidence for [P] and [q] is evidence for [Q]; and

    - this is the _only_ way to give evidence for [and P Q] --
      that is, if someone gives us evidence for [and P Q], we
      know it must have the form [conj p q], where [p] is
      evidence for [P] and [q] is evidence for [Q]. 

   Since we'll be using conjunction a lot, let's introduce a more
   familiar-looking infix notation for it. *)

Notation "P /\ Q" := (and P Q) : type_scope.

(** (The [type_scope] annotation tells Coq that this notation
    will be appearing in propositions, not values.) *)

(** Consider the "type" of the constructor [conj]: *)

Check conj.
(* ===>  forall P Q : Prop, P -> Q -> P /\ Q *)

(** Notice that it takes 4 inputs -- namely the propositions [P]
    and [Q] and evidence for [P] and [Q] -- and returns as output the
    evidence of [P /\ Q]. *)

(** Besides the elegance of building everything up from a tiny
    foundation, what's nice about defining conjunction this way is
    that we can prove statements involving conjunction using the
    tactics that we already know.  For example, if the goal statement
    is a conjuction, we can prove it by applying the single
    constructor [conj], which (as can be seen from the type of [conj])
    solves the current goal and leaves the two parts of the
    conjunction as subgoals to be proved separately. *)

Theorem and_example : 
  (beautiful 0) /\ (beautiful 3).
Proof.
  apply conj.
  Case "left". apply b_0.
  Case "right". apply b_3.  Qed.

(** Just for convenience, we can use the tactic [split] as a shorthand for
    [apply conj]. *)

Theorem and_example' : 
  (ev 0) /\ (ev 4).
Proof.
  split.
    Case "left". apply ev_0.
    Case "right". apply ev_SS. apply ev_SS. apply ev_0.  Qed.

(** Conversely, the [inversion] tactic can be used to take a
    conjunction hypothesis in the context, calculate what evidence
    must have been used to build it, and add variables representing
    this evidence to the proof context. *)

Theorem proj1 : forall P Q : Prop, 
  P /\ Q -> P.
Proof.
  intros P Q H.
  inversion H as [HP HQ].

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars (and_assoc) *)
(** In the following proof, notice how the _nested pattern_ in the
    [inversion] breaks the hypothesis [H : P /\ (Q /\ R)] down into
    [HP: P], [HQ : Q], and [HR : R].  Finish the proof from there: *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars (even__ev) *)
(** Now we can prove the other direction of the equivalence of [even]
   and [ev], which we left hanging in chapter [Prop].  Notice that the
   left-hand conjunct here is the statement we are actually interested
   in; the right-hand conjunct is needed in order to make the
   induction hypothesis strong enough that we can carry out the
   reasoning in the inductive step.  (To see why this is needed, try
   proving the left conjunct by itself and observe where things get
   stuck.) *)

(* ###################################################### *)
(** ** Iff *)

(** The handy "if and only if" connective is just the conjunction of
    two implications. *)

Definition iff (P Q : Prop) := (P -> Q) /\ (Q -> P).

Notation "P <-> Q" := (iff P Q) 
                      (at level 95, no associativity) 
                      : type_scope.

Theorem iff_implies : forall P Q : Prop, 
  (P <-> Q) -> P -> Q.
Proof.  
  intros P Q H. 
  inversion H as [HAB HBA]. apply HAB.  Qed.

Theorem iff_sym : forall P Q : Prop,

  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)

  split.
    Case "->". apply HBA.
    Case "<-". apply HAB.  Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, optional (iff_properties) *)
(** Using the above proof that [<->] is symmetric ([iff_sym]) as
    a guide, prove that it is also reflexive and transitive. *)

  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Theorem iff_trans : forall P Q R : Prop, 
  (P <-> Q) -> (Q <-> R) -> (P <-> R).
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

(** Hint: If you have an iff hypothesis in the context, you can use
    [inversion] to break it into two separate implications.  (Think
    about why this works.) *)
(** [] *)



(** Some of Coq's tactics treat [iff] statements specially, thus
    avoiding the need for some low-level manipulation when reasoning
    with them.  In particular, [rewrite] can be used with [iff]
    statements, not just equalities. *)

(* ############################################################ *)
(** * Disjunction *)

(** Disjunction ("logical or") can also be defined as an
    inductive proposition. *)

Inductive or (P Q : Prop) : Prop :=
  | or_introl : P -> or P Q
  | or_intror : Q -> or P Q. 

Notation "P \/ Q" := (or P Q) : type_scope.

(** Consider the "type" of the constructor [or_introl]: *)

Check or_introl.
(* ===>  forall P Q : Prop, P -> P \/ Q *)

(** It takes 3 inputs, namely the propositions [P], [Q] and
    evidence of [P], and returns, as output, the evidence of [P \/ Q].
    Next, look at the type of [or_intror]: *)

Check or_intror.
(* ===>  forall P Q : Prop, Q -> P \/ Q *)

(** It is like [or_introl] but it requires evidence of [Q]
    instead of evidence of [P]. *)

(** Intuitively, there are two ways of giving evidence for [P \/ Q]:

    - give evidence for [P] (and say that it is [P] you are giving
      evidence for -- this is the function of the [or_introl]
      constructor), or

    - give evidence for [Q], tagged with the [or_intror]
      constructor. *)

(** Since [P \/ Q] has two constructors, doing [inversion] on a
    hypothesis of type [P \/ Q] yields two subgoals. *)

Theorem or_commut : forall P Q : Prop,
  P \/ Q  -> Q \/ P.
Proof.
  intros P Q H.
  inversion H as [HP | HQ].
    Case "left". apply or_intror. apply HP.
    Case "right". apply or_introl. apply HQ.  Qed.

(** From here on, we'll use the shorthand tactics [left] and [right]
    in place of [apply or_introl] and [apply or_intror]. *)

Theorem or_commut' : forall P Q : Prop,
  P \/ Q  -> Q \/ P.
Proof.
  intros P Q H.
  inversion H as [HP | HQ].
    Case "left". right. apply HP.
    Case "right". left. apply HQ.  Qed.





Theorem or_distributes_over_and_1 : forall P Q R : Prop,
  P \/ (Q /\ R) -> (P \/ Q) /\ (P \/ R).
Proof. 
  intros P Q R. intros H. inversion H as [HP | [HQ HR]]. 
    Case "left". split.

(** ** Relating [/\] and [\/] with [andb] and [orb] (advanced) *)

(** We've already seen several places where analogous structures
    can be found in Coq's computational ([Type]) and logical ([Prop])
    worlds.  Here is one more: the boolean operators [andb] and [orb]
    are clearly analogs of the logical connectives [/\] and [\/].
    This analogy can be made more precise by the following theorems,
    which show how to translate knowledge about [andb] and [orb]'s
    behaviors on certain inputs into propositional facts about those
    inputs. *)

(* ################################################### *)
(** * Falsehood *)

(** Logical falsehood can be represented in Coq as an inductively
    defined proposition with no constructors. *)

Inductive False : Prop := . 

(** Intuition: [False] is a proposition for which there is no way
    to give evidence. *)


(** Since [False] has no constructors, inverting an assumption
    of type [False] always yields zero subgoals, allowing us to
    immediately prove any goal. *)

Theorem False_implies_nonsense :
  False -> 2 + 2 = 5.
Proof. 
  intros contra.
  inversion contra.  Qed. 

(** How does this work? The [inversion] tactic breaks [contra] into
    each of its possible cases, and yields a subgoal for each case.
    As [contra] is evidence for [False], it has _no_ possible cases,
    hence, there are no possible subgoals and the proof is done. *)

(** Conversely, the only way to prove [False] is if there is already
    something nonsensical or contradictory in the context: *)

Theorem nonsense_implies_False :
  2 + 2 = 5 -> False.
Proof.
  intros contra.
  inversion contra.  Qed.

(** Actually, since the proof of [False_implies_nonsense]
    doesn't actually have anything to do with the specific nonsensical
    thing being proved; it can easily be generalized to work for an
    arbitrary [P]: *)

Theorem ex_falso_quodlibet : forall (P:Prop),
  False -> P.
Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)
  intros P contra.
  inversion contra.  Qed.

(** The Latin _ex falso quodlibet_ means, literally, "from
    falsehood follows whatever you please."  This theorem is also
    known as the _principle of explosion_. *)


(* #################################################### *)
(** ** Truth *)

(** Since we have defined falsehood in Coq, one might wonder whether
    it is possible to define truth in the same way.  We can. *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, advanced (True) *)
(** Define [True] as another inductively defined proposition.  (The
    intution is that [True] should be a proposition for which it is
    trivial to give evidence.) *)

(* FILL IN HERE *)
(** [] *)

(** However, unlike [False], which we'll use extensively, [True] is
    used fairly rarely. By itself, it is trivial (and therefore
    uninteresting) to prove as a goal, and it carries no useful
    information as a hypothesis. But it can be useful when defining
    complex [Prop]s using conditionals, or as a parameter to 
    higher-order [Prop]s. *)

(* #################################################### *)
(** * Negation *)

(** The logical complement of a proposition [P] is written [not
    P] or, for shorthand, [~P]: *)

Definition not (P:Prop) := P -> False.

(** The intuition is that, if [P] is not true, then anything at
    all (even [False]) follows from assuming [P]. *)

Notation "~ x" := (not x) : type_scope.

Check not.
(* ===> Prop -> Prop *)

(** It takes a little practice to get used to working with
    negation in Coq.  Even though you can see perfectly well why
    something is true, it can be a little hard at first to get things
    into the right configuration so that Coq can see it!  Here are
    proofs of a few familiar facts about negation to get you warmed
    up. *)

    what is "built in" to Coq).  We can't prove them in Coq, but

(** Saying [x <> y] is just the same as saying [~(x = y)]. *)

Notation "x <> y" := (~ (x = y)) : type_scope.

(** Since inequality involves a negation, it again requires
    a little practice to be able to work with it fluently.  Here
    is one very useful trick.  If you are trying to prove a goal
    that is nonsensical (e.g., the goal state is [false = true]),
    apply the lemma [ex_falso_quodlibet] to change the goal to
    [False].  This makes it easier to use assumptions of the form
    [~P] that are available in the context -- in particular,
    assumptions of the form [x<>y]. *)

(* ############################################################ *)
(** * Existential Quantification *)

(** Another critical logical connective is _existential
    quantification_.  We can express it with the following
    definition: *)

Inductive ex (X:Type) (P : X->Prop) : Prop :=
  ex_intro : forall (witness:X), P witness -> ex X P.

(** That is, [ex] is a family of propositions indexed by a type [X]
    and a property [P] over [X].  In order to give evidence for the
    assertion "there exists an [x] for which the property [P] holds"
    we must actually name a _witness_ -- a specific value [x] -- and
    then give evidence for [P x], i.e., evidence that [x] has the
    property [P]. 

*)


(** Coq's [Notation] facility can be used to introduce more
    familiar notation for writing existentially quantified
    propositions, exactly parallel to the built-in syntax for
    universally quantified propositions.  Instead of writing [ex nat
    ev] to express the proposition that there exists some number that
    is even, for example, we can write [exists x:nat, ev x].  (It is
    not necessary to understand exactly how the [Notation] definition
    works.) *)

Notation "'exists' x , p" := (ex _ (fun x => p))
  (at level 200, x ident, right associativity) : type_scope.
Notation "'exists' x : X , p" := (ex _ (fun x:X => p))
  (at level 200, x ident, right associativity) : type_scope.

(** We can use the usual set of tactics for
    manipulating existentials.  For example, to prove an
    existential, we can [apply] the constructor [ex_intro].  Since the
    premise of [ex_intro] involves a variable ([witness]) that does
    not appear in its conclusion, we need to explicitly give its value
    when we use [apply]. *)

Example exists_example_1 : exists n, n + (n * n) = 6.
Proof.
  apply ex_intro with (witness:=2). 
  reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Note that we have to explicitly give the witness. *)

(** Or, instead of writing [apply ex_intro with (witness:=e)] all the
    time, we can use the convenient shorthand [exists e], which means
    the same thing. *)

Example exists_example_1' : exists n, n + (n * n) = 6.
Proof.
  exists 2. 
  reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Conversely, if we have an existential hypothesis in the
    context, we can eliminate it with [inversion].  Note the use
    of the [as...] pattern to name the variable that Coq
    introduces to name the witness value and get evidence that
    the hypothesis holds for the witness.  (If we don't
    explicitly choose one, Coq will just call it [witness], which
    makes proofs confusing.) *)

(* ###################################################### *)
(** * Equality *)

(** Even Coq's equality relation is not built in.  It has (roughly)
    the following inductive definition. *)

(* (We enclose the definition in a module to avoid confusion with the
    standard library equality, which we have used extensively
    already.) *)

Module MyEquality.

Inductive eq {X:Type} : X -> X -> Prop :=
  refl_equal : forall x, eq x x.
(** Standard infix notation: *)

Notation "x = y" := (eq x y) 
                    (at level 70, no associativity) 
                    : type_scope.

(** The definition of [=] is a bit subtle.  The way to think about it
    is that, given a set [X], it defines a _family_ of propositions
    "[x] is equal to [y]," indexed by pairs of values ([x] and [y])
    from [X].  There is just one way of constructing evidence for
    members of this family: applying the constructor [refl_equal] to a
    type [X] and a value [x : X] yields evidence that [x] is equal to
    [x]. *)


(** **** Exercise: 2 stars (leibniz_equality) *)
(** The inductive definitions of equality corresponds to _Leibniz equality_:

(** We can use
    [refl_equal] to construct evidence that, for example, [2 = 2].
    Can we also use it to construct evidence that [1 + 1 = 2]?  Yes:
    indeed, it is the very same piece of evidence!  The reason is that
    Coq treats as "the same" any two terms that are _convertible_
    according to a simple set of computation rules.  These rules,
    which are similar to those used by [Eval compute], include
    evaluation of function application, inlining of definitions, and
    simplification of [match]es.

(** * Evidence-carrying booleans. *)

(** So far we've seen two different forms of equality predicates:
[eq], which produces a [Prop], and
the type-specific forms, like [beq_nat], that produce [boolean]
values.  The former are more convenient to reason about, but
we've relied on the latter to let us use equality tests 
in _computations_.  While it is straightforward to write lemmas
(e.g. [beq_nat_true] and [beq_nat_false]) that connect the two forms,
using these lemmas quickly gets tedious. 

It turns out that we can get the benefits of both forms at once 
by using a construct called [sumbool]. *)

Inductive sumbool (A B : Prop) : Set :=
 | left : A -> sumbool A B 
 | right : B -> sumbool A B.

Notation "{ A } + { B }" :=  (sumbool A B) : type_scope.

(** Think of [sumbool] as being like the [boolean] type, but instead
of its values being just [true] and [false], they carry _evidence_
of truth or falsity. This means that when we [destruct] them, we
are left with the relevant evidence as a hypothesis -- just as with [or].
(In fact, the definition of [sumbool] is almost the same as for [or].
The only difference is that values of [sumbool] are declared to be in
[Set] rather than in [Prop]; this is a technical distinction 
that allows us to compute with them.) *) 

(** Here's how we can define a [sumbool] for equality on [nat]s *)

Theorem eq_nat_dec : forall n m : nat, {n = m} + {n <> m}.
Proof.
  intros n.
  induction n as [|n'].
  Case "n = 0".
    intros m.
    destruct m as [|m'].
    SCase "m = 0".
      left. reflexivity.
    SCase "m = S m'".
      right. intros contra. inversion contra.
  Case "n = S n'".
    intros m.
    destruct m as [|m'].
    SCase "m = 0".
      right. intros contra. inversion contra.
    SCase "m = S m'". 
      destruct IHn' with (m := m') as [eq | neq].
      left. apply f_equal.  apply eq.
      right. intros Heq. inversion Heq as [Heq']. apply neq. apply Heq'.
Defined. 

(** Read as a theorem, this says that equality on [nat]s is decidable:
that is, given two [nat] values, we can always produce either 
evidence that they are equal or evidence that they are not.
Read computationally, [eq_nat_dec] takes two [nat] values and returns
a [sumbool] constructed with [left] if they are equal and [right] 
if they are not; this result can be tested with a [match] or, better,
with an [if-then-else], just like a regular [boolean]. 
(Notice that we ended this proof with [Defined] rather than [Qed]. 
The only difference this makes is that the proof becomes _transparent_,
meaning that its definition is available when Coq tries to do reductions,
which is important for the computational interpretation.)

Here's a simple example illustrating the advantages of the [sumbool] form. *)

Definition override' {X: Type} (f: nat->X) (k:nat) (x:X) : nat->X:=
  fun (k':nat) => if eq_nat_dec k k' then x else f k'.

Theorem override_same' : forall (X:Type) x1 k1 k2 (f : nat->X),
  f k1 = x1 -> 
  (override' f k1 x1) k2 = f k2.
Proof.
  intros X x1 k1 k2 f. intros Hx1.
  unfold override'.
  destruct (eq_nat_dec k1 k2).   (* observe what appears as a hypothesis *)
  Case "k1 = k2".
    rewrite <- e.
    symmetry. apply Hx1.
  Case "k1 <> k2". 
    reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Compare this to the more laborious proof (in MoreCoq.v) for the 
   version of [override] defined using [beq_nat], where we had to
   use the auxiliary lemma [beq_nat_true] to convert a fact about booleans
   to a Prop. *)

(** ** Inversion, Again (Advanced) *)

(** We've seen [inversion] used with both equality hypotheses and
    hypotheses about inductively defined propositions.  Now that we've
    seen that these are actually the same thing, we're in a position
    to take a closer look at how [inversion] behaves...

    In general, the [inversion] tactic

    - takes a hypothesis [H] whose type [P] is inductively defined,
      and

    - for each constructor [C] in [P]'s definition,

      - generates a new subgoal in which we assume [H] was
        built with [C],

      - adds the arguments (premises) of [C] to the context of
        the subgoal as extra hypotheses,

      - matches the conclusion (result type) of [C] against the
        current goal and calculates a set of equalities that must
        hold in order for [C] to be applicable,
        
      - adds these equalities to the context (and, for convenience,
        rewrites them in the goal), and

      - if the equalities are not satisfiable (e.g., they involve
        things like [S n = O]), immediately solves the subgoal. *)

(** _Example_: If we invert a hypothesis built with [or], there are two
   constructors, so two subgoals get generated.  The
   conclusion (result type) of the constructor ([P \/ Q]) doesn't
   place any restrictions on the form of [P] or [Q], so we don't get
   any extra equalities in the context of the subgoal.

   _Example_: If we invert a hypothesis built with [and], there is
   only one constructor, so only one subgoal gets generated.  Again,
   the conclusion (result type) of the constructor ([P /\ Q]) doesn't
   place any restrictions on the form of [P] or [Q], so we don't get
   any extra equalities in the context of the subgoal.  The
   constructor does have two arguments, though, and these can be seen
   in the context in the subgoal.

   _Example_: If we invert a hypothesis built with [eq], there is
   again only one constructor, so only one subgoal gets generated.
   Now, though, the form of the [refl_equal] constructor does give us
   some extra information: it tells us that the two arguments to [eq]
   must be the same!  The [inversion] tactic adds this fact to the
   context.  *)

(** * Additional Exercises *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars (all_forallb) *)
(** Inductively define a property [all] of lists, parameterized by a
    type [X] and a property [P : X -> Prop], such that [all X P l]

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, advanced (filter_challenge) *)
(** One of the main purposes of Coq is to prove that programs match
    their specifications.  To this end, let's prove that our
    definition of [filter] matches a specification.  Here is the
    specification, written out informally in English.

    Suppose we have a set [X], a function [test: X->bool], and a list
    [l] of type [list X].  Suppose further that [l] is an "in-order
    merge" of two lists, [l1] and [l2], such that every item in [l1]
    satisfies [test] and no item in [l2] satisfies test.  Then [filter
    test l = l1].

    A list [l] is an "in-order merge" of [l1] and [l2] if it contains
    all the same elements as [l1] and [l2], in the same order as [l1]
    and [l2], but possibly interleaved.  For example, 
    [1,4,6,2,3]
    is an in-order merge of
    [1,6,2]
    and
    [4,3].
    Your job is to translate this specification into a Coq theorem and
    prove it.  (Hint: You'll need to begin by defining what it means
    for one list to be a merge of two others.  Do this with an
    inductive relation, not a [Fixpoint].)  *)

    [no_repeats X l], which should be provable exactly when [l] is a

    [no_repeats bool []] should be provable, while [no_repeats nat
    [1,2,1]] and [no_repeats bool [true,true]] should not be.  *)

    number consecutively.  The predicate "[nostutter mylist]" means
    that [mylist] does not stutter.  Formulate an inductive definition
    for [nostutter].  (This is different from the [no_repeats]
