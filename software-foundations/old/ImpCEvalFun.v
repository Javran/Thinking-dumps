(** ** Evaluation Function *)

Require Import Imp.

(** Here's a first try at an evaluation function for commands,
    omitting [WHILE]. *)

Fixpoint ceval_step1 (st : state) (c : com) : state :=
  match c with 
    | SKIP => 
        st
    | l ::= a1 => 
        update st l (aeval st a1)
    | c1 ;; c2 => 
        let st' := ceval_step1 st c1 in
        ceval_step1 st' c2
    | IFB b THEN c1 ELSE c2 FI => 
        if (beval st b) 
          then ceval_step1 st c1 
          else ceval_step1 st c2
    | WHILE b1 DO c1 END => 
        st  (* bogus *)
  end.

(** In a traditional functional programming language like ML or
    Haskell we could write the WHILE case as follows:
<<
    | WHILE b1 DO c1 END => 
        if (beval st b1) 
          then ceval_step1 st (c1;; WHILE b1 DO c1 END)
          else st 
>>
    Coq doesn't accept such a definition ([Error: Cannot guess
    decreasing argument of fix]) because the function we want to
    define is not guaranteed to terminate. Indeed, the changed
    [ceval_step1] function applied to the [loop] program from [Imp.v] would
    never terminate. Since Coq is not just a functional programming
    language, but also a consistent logic, any potentially
    non-terminating function needs to be rejected. Here is an
    invalid(!) Coq program showing what would go wrong if Coq allowed
    non-terminating recursive functions:
<<
     Fixpoint loop_false (n : nat) : False := loop_false n.
>>
    That is, propositions like [False] would become
    provable (e.g. [loop_false 0] would be a proof of [False]), which
    would be a disaster for Coq's logical consistency.

    Thus, because it doesn't terminate on all inputs, the full version
    of [ceval_step1] cannot be written in Coq -- at least not
    without one additional trick... *)


(** Second try, using an extra numeric argument as a "step index" to
    ensure that evaluation always terminates. *)

Fixpoint ceval_step2 (st : state) (c : com) (i : nat) : state :=
  match i with 
  | O => empty_state
  | S i' =>
    match c with 
      | SKIP => 
          st
      | l ::= a1 => 
          update st l (aeval st a1)
      | c1 ;; c2 => 
          let st' := ceval_step2 st c1 i' in
          ceval_step2 st' c2 i' 
      | IFB b THEN c1 ELSE c2 FI => 
          if (beval st b) 
            then ceval_step2 st c1 i' 
            else ceval_step2 st c2 i'
      | WHILE b1 DO c1 END => 
          if (beval st b1) 
          then let st' := ceval_step2 st c1 i' in
               ceval_step2 st' c i'
          else st
    end
  end.

(** _Note_: It is tempting to think that the index [i] here is
    counting the "number of steps of evaluation."  But if you look
    closely you'll see that this is not the case: for example, in the
    rule for sequencing, the same [i] is passed to both recursive
    calls.  Understanding the exact way that [i] is treated will be
    important in the proof of [ceval__ceval_step], which is given as
    an exercise below. *)

(** Third try, returning an [option state] instead of just a [state]
    so that we can distinguish between normal and abnormal
    termination. *)

Fixpoint ceval_step3 (st : state) (c : com) (i : nat) 
                    : option state :=
  match i with 
  | O => None
  | S i' =>
    match c with 
      | SKIP => 
          Some st
      | l ::= a1 => 
          Some (update st l (aeval st a1))
      | c1 ;; c2 => 
          match (ceval_step3 st c1 i') with
          | Some st' => ceval_step3 st' c2 i'
          | None => None
          end
      | IFB b THEN c1 ELSE c2 FI => 
          if (beval st b) 
            then ceval_step3 st c1 i' 
            else ceval_step3 st c2 i'
      | WHILE b1 DO c1 END => 
          if (beval st b1)           
          then match (ceval_step3 st c1 i') with
               | Some st' => ceval_step3 st' c i'
               | None => None
               end
          else Some st
    end
  end.

(** We can improve the readability of this definition by introducing a
    bit of auxiliary notation to hide the "plumbing" involved in
    repeatedly matching against optional states. *)

Notation "'LETOPT' x <== e1 'IN' e2" 
   := (match e1 with
         | Some x => e2
         | None => None
       end)
   (right associativity, at level 60).

                    : option state :=
