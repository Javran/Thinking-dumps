(** * Prop: Propositions and Evidence *)

Require Export MoreCoq.

(** In previous chapters, we have seen many examples of factual
    claims (_propositions_) and ways of presenting evidence of their
    truth (_proofs_).  In particular, we have worked extensively with
    _equality propositions_ of the form [e1 = e2], with
    implications ([P -> Q]), and with quantified propositions 
    ([forall x, P]).  

    This chapter will take us on a first tour of the
    propositional (logical) side of Coq.
    In particular, we will expand our repertoire of primitive
    propositions to include _user-defined_ propositions, not just
    equality propositions (which are more-or-less "built in" to Coq).

(* ##################################################### *)
(** * Inductively Defined Propositions *)

(**  As a running example, let's
    define a simple property of natural numbers -- we'll call it
    "[beautiful]." *)

(** Informally, a number is [beautiful] if it is [0], [3], [5], or the
    sum of two [beautiful] numbers.  

    More pedantically, we can define [beautiful] numbers by giving four
    rules:

       - Rule [b_0]: The number [0] is [beautiful].
       - Rule [b_3]: The number [3] is [beautiful]. 
       - Rule [b_5]: The number [5] is [beautiful]. 
       - Rule [b_sum]: If [n] and [m] are both [beautiful], then so is
         their sum. *)

(** We will see many definitions like this one during the rest
    of the course, and for purposes of informal discussions, it is
    helpful to have a lightweight notation that makes them easy to
    read and write.  _Inference rules_ are one such notation: *)
(**
                              -----------                               (b_0)
                              beautiful 0
                              
                              ------------                              (b_3)
                              beautiful 3

                              ------------                              (b_5)
                              beautiful 5    

                       beautiful n     beautiful m
                       ---------------------------                      (b_sum)
                              beautiful (n+m)   
*)

(** Each of the textual rules above is reformatted here as an
    inference rule; the intended reading is that, if the _premises_
    above the line all hold, then the _conclusion_ below the line
    follows.  For example, the rule [b_sum] says that, if [n] and [m]
    are both [beautiful] numbers, then it follows that [n+m] is
    [beautiful] too.  If a rule has no premises above the line, then
    its conclusion hold unconditionally.

    These rules _define_ the property [beautiful].  That is, if we
    want to convince someone that some particular number is [beautiful],
    our argument must be based on these rules.  For a simple example,
    suppose we claim that the number [5] is [beautiful].  To support
    this claim, we just need to point out that rule [b_5] says so.
    Or, if we want to claim that [8] is [beautiful], we can support our
    claim by first observing that [3] and [5] are both [beautiful] (by
    rules [b_3] and [b_5]) and then pointing out that their sum, [8],
    is therefore [beautiful] by rule [b_sum].  This argument can be
    expressed graphically with the following _proof tree_: *)
(**
         ----------- (b_3)   ----------- (b_5)
         beautiful 3         beautiful 5
         ------------------------------- (b_sum)
                   beautiful 8   
    Of course, there are other ways of using these rules to argue that
    [8] is [beautiful], for instance:
         ----------- (b_5)   ----------- (b_3)
         beautiful 5         beautiful 3
         ------------------------------- (b_sum)
                   beautiful 8   
*)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star (varieties_of_beauty) *)
(** How many different ways are there to show that [8] is [beautiful]? *)

(* FILL IN HERE *)
(** [] *)

(** In Coq, we can express the definition of [beautiful] as
    follows: *)

Inductive beautiful : nat -> Prop :=
  b_0   : beautiful 0
| b_3   : beautiful 3
| b_5   : beautiful 5
| b_sum : forall n m, beautiful n -> beautiful m -> beautiful (n+m).


(** The first line declares that [beautiful] is a proposition -- or,
    more formally, a family of propositions "indexed by" natural
    numbers.  (That is, for each number [n], the claim that "[n] is
    [beautiful]" is a proposition.)  Such a family of propositions is
    often called a _property_ of numbers.  Each of the remaining lines
    embodies one of the rules for [beautiful] numbers.

    The rules introduced this way have the same status as proven 
    theorems; that is, they are true axiomatically. 
    So we can use Coq's [apply] tactic with the rule names to prove 
    that particular numbers are [beautiful].  *)

Theorem three_is_beautiful: beautiful 3.
Proof.
   (* This simply follows from the rule [b_3]. *)
   apply b_3.

Theorem eight_is_beautiful: beautiful 8.

   (* To solve the subgoals generated by [b_sum], we must provide
      evidence of [beautiful 3] and [beautiful 5]. Fortunately we
      have rules for both. *)
   apply b_3.
   apply b_5.

(** As you would expect, we can also prove theorems that have

(* ####################################################### *)
(** ** Induction Over Evidence *)

(** Besides _constructing_ evidence that numbers are beautiful, we can
    also _reason about_ such evidence. *)

(** The fact that we introduced [beautiful] with an [Inductive]
    declaration tells Coq not only that the constructors [b_0], [b_3],
    [b_5] and [b_sum] are ways to build evidence, but also that these
    two constructors are the _only_ ways to build evidence that
    numbers are beautiful. *)

(** In other words, if someone gives us evidence [E] for the assertion
    [beautiful n], then we know that [E] must have one of four shapes:

      - [E] is [b_0] (and [n] is [O]),
      - [E] is [b_3] (and [n] is [3]), 
      - [E] is [b_5] (and [n] is [5]), or 
      - [E] is [b_sum n1 n2 E1 E2] (and [n] is [n1+n2], where [E1] is
        evidence that [n1] is beautiful and [E2] is evidence that [n2]
        is beautiful). *)
    
(** This permits us to _analyze_ any hypothesis of the form [beautiful
    n] to see how it was constructed, using the tactics we already
    know.  In particular, we can use the [induction] tactic that we
    have already seen for reasoning about inductively defined _data_
    to reason about inductively defined _evidence_.

    To illustrate this, let's define another property of numbers: *)

Inductive gorgeous : nat -> Prop :=
  g_0 : gorgeous 0
| g_plus3 : forall n, gorgeous n -> gorgeous (3+n)
| g_plus5 : forall n, gorgeous n -> gorgeous (5+n).

(** It seems intuitively obvious that, although [gorgeous] and
    [beautiful] are presented using slightly different rules, they are
    actually the same property in the sense that they are true of the
    same numbers.  Indeed, we can prove this. *)

Theorem gorgeous__beautiful : forall n, 
  gorgeous n -> beautiful n.

   Case "g_0".
       apply b_0.

   Case "g_plus5".
       apply b_sum. apply b_5. apply IHgorgeous.

(** Notice that the argument proceeds by induction on the _evidence_ [H]! *) 

(** Let's see what happens if we try to prove this by induction on [n]
   instead of induction on the evidence [H]. *)

  gorgeous n -> beautiful n.
Proof.
   intros. induction n as [| n'].
   Case "n = 0". apply b_0.
   Case "n = S n'". (* We are stuck! *)
Abort.

(** The problem here is that doing induction on [n] doesn't yield a
    useful induction hypothesis. Knowing how the property we are
    interested in behaves on the predecessor of [n] doesn't help us
    prove that it holds for [n]. Instead, we would like to be able to
    have induction hypotheses that mention other numbers, such as [n -
    3] and [n - 5]. This is given precisely by the shape of the
    constructors for [gorgeous]. *)

(* ####################################################### *)
(** ** From Boolean Functions to Propositions *)

(** In chapter [Basics] we defined a _function_ [evenb] that tests a
    number for evenness, yielding [true] if so.  We can use this
    function to define the _proposition_ that some number [n] is
    even: *)

Definition even (n:nat) : Prop := 
  evenb n = true.

(** That is, we can define "[n] is even" to mean "the function [evenb]
    returns [true] when applied to [n]."  

    Note that here we have given a name
    to a proposition using a [Definition], just as we have
    given names to expressions of other sorts. This isn't a fundamentally
    new kind of proposition;  it is still just an equality. *)

(** Another alternative is to define the concept of evenness
    directly.  Instead of going via the [evenb] function ("a number is
    even if a certain computation yields [true]"), we can say what the
    concept of evenness means by giving two different ways of
    presenting _evidence_ that a number is even. *)

Inductive ev : nat -> Prop :=
  | ev_0 : ev O
  | ev_SS : forall n:nat, ev n -> ev (S (S n)).

(** This definition says that there are two ways to give
    evidence that a number [m] is even.  First, [0] is even, and
    [ev_0] is evidence for this.  Second, if [m = S (S n)] for some
    [n] and we can give evidence [e] that [n] is even, then [m] is
    also even, and [ev_SS n e] is the evidence. *)

(** *** Discussion: Computational vs. Inductive Definitions *)

(** We have seen that the proposition "[n] is even" can be
    phrased in two different ways -- indirectly, via a boolean testing
    function [evenb], or directly, by inductively describing what
    constitutes evidence for evenness.  These two ways of defining
    evenness are about equally easy to state and work with.  Which we
    choose is basically a question of taste.

    However, for many other properties of interest, the direct
    inductive definition is preferable, since writing a testing
    function may be awkward or even impossible.  

    One such property is [beautiful].  This is a perfectly sensible
    definition of a set of numbers, but we cannot translate its
    definition directly into a Coq Fixpoint (or into a recursive
    function in any other common programming language).  We might be
    able to find a clever way of testing this property using a
    [Fixpoint] (indeed, it is not too hard to find one in this case),
    but in general this could require arbitrarily deep thinking.  In
    fact, if the property we are interested in is uncomputable, then
    we cannot define it as a [Fixpoint] no matter how hard we try,
    because Coq requires that all [Fixpoint]s correspond to
    terminating computations.

    On the other hand, writing an inductive definition of what it
    means to give evidence for the property [beautiful] is
    straightforward. *)




(** **** Exercise: 1 star (ev__even) *)
(** Here is a proof that the inductive definition of evenness implies
    the computational one. *)

Theorem ev__even : forall n,
  ev n -> even n.

(** Could this proof also be carried out by induction on [n] instead

(** The induction principle for inductively defined propositions does
    not follow quite the same form as that of inductively defined
    sets.  For now, you can take the intuitive view that induction on
    evidence [ev n] is similar to induction on [n], but restricts our
    attention to only those numbers for which evidence [ev n] could be
    generated.  We'll look at the induction principle of [ev] in more
    depth below, to explain what's really going on. *)

(** ** [Inversion] on Evidence *)

(** Another situation where we want to analyze evidence for evenness
    is when proving that, if [n] is even, then [pred (pred n))] is
    too.  In this case, we don't need to do an inductive proof.  The
    right tactic turns out to be [inversion].  *)

Theorem ev_minus2: forall n,
  ev n -> ev (pred (pred n)). 
Proof.
  intros n E.
  inversion E as [| n' E'].

(** What happens if we try to use [destruct] on [n] instead of [inversion] on [E]? *)

(* FILL IN HERE *)
(** [] *)


(** Another example, in which [inversion] helps narrow down to
the relevant cases. *)

Theorem SSev__even : forall n,
  ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.
Proof.
  intros n E. 
  inversion E as [| n' E']. 
  apply E'. Qed.

(** These uses of [inversion] may seem a bit mysterious at first.
    Until now, we've only used [inversion] on equality
    propositions, to utilize injectivity of constructors or to
    discriminate between different constructors.  But we see here
    that [inversion] can also be applied to analyzing evidence
    for inductively defined propositions.

    (You might also expect that [destruct] would be a more suitable
    tactic to use here. Indeed, it is possible to use [destruct], but 
    it often throws away useful information, and the [eqn:] qualifier
    doesn't help much in this case.)    

    Here's how [inversion] works in general.  Suppose the name
    [I] refers to an assumption [P] in the current context, where
    [P] has been defined by an [Inductive] declaration.  Then,
    for each of the constructors of [P], [inversion I] generates
    a subgoal in which [I] has been replaced by the exact,
    specific conditions under which this constructor could have
    been used to prove [P].  Some of these subgoals will be
    self-contradictory; [inversion] throws these away.  The ones
    that are left represent the cases that must be proved to
    establish the original goal.

    In this particular case, the [inversion] analyzed the construction
    [ev (S (S n))], determined that this could only have been
    constructed using [ev_SS], and generated a new subgoal with the
    arguments of that constructor as new hypotheses.  (It also
    produced an auxiliary equality, which happens to be useless here.)
    We'll begin exploring this more general behavior of inversion in
    what follows. *)
